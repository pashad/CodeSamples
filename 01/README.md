IMPORTANT:

These files are just code examples extracted (and refactored a bit) from the huge project. 
They were put here just to show how the code I wrote looks like.

Including:
- type hints
- dataclasses + `dacite` module to work with dataclasses
- `pytest` usage
- code formatting tools (`black`, `isort`) and linters(`flake8`) applied

P.S. I know that some developers don't like camel-case, 
but this is how we used to do in that project
