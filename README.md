Hey! My name is Pavel.

In this repo you can find some examples of the python code written by me recently:

- [01](01) These are some extracts from the project for the company
 obtained Unicorn status when I worked there. NOTE: this is not something you can setup/run locally,
 just some code samples showing different areas I'm familiar with. More details in 01 Readme.
- [02](02) This is a test Django project about processing large text inputs (3 options: raw text input, URLs, local file path).
Multiprocessing is used. More details in 02 Readme.
- [03](03) Took part in protocol54 development.
